Professor Alex helped me a bit with the map

I actually understood this lab fairly well and the only big challenge I face is that I was getting the wrong reading for the family length of my
program. It was super tricky and hard to find but I eventually I saw that I was printing out the family length before I was actually processing the
guess. It was a super easy fix once I pinpointed the problem. It was just incredibly hard for me to find for some reason. I fixed the bug by moving
my cout underneat the process guess function call in main and it worked like a charm. 


I liked how fun this assignment was. It was a little tricky but the game we made was facinating and it was cool seeing just how much of a difference 
efficiency makes. In most cases it wouldn't really matter if the game was a couple seconds slower, but in a game like evil hangman we had to make our
code as fast as possible so that nobody would suspect whats truly at work. To sum it up, I think it was cool that we actually had a reason to make 
our code efficient. Something I disliked about this assignment was how long it took to playtest the game. Every single game took at least five minutes
of just spamming random letters. It also sucked because it would be hard to tell which letters you haven't played yet after a while. 

I didn't add any novel features(unfortunately because of to many midterms this week).
